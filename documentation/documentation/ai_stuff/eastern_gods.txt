I'm going to need you to make building descriptions for shrines dedicated to certain gods for cultures in my mod for Rome Total War remastered.
I want them to be made similar to the ones already in the base game.

What I want you to do:
From the examples, take into account their length, style, tense, and historicity
Stay consistent with the examples, though small occasional deviances are permitted
Use reputable online resources
Use 2 sentences, no more and no less
No more than 350 characters
No less than 150 characters
Try to include historical references

What I do NOT want you to do:
Do not write in the past-tense as if looking back
Do not refer to modern locations
Do not make up false information
Do not write descriptions as if writing them back to back (e.g. saying a god is a "god of war" in one description, and saying "another god of war" in the next)
Do not copy the info in the parentheses next to the god's name word-for-word (e.g. saying a god is a "sky father god". make it sound natural, "God of the sky")
Do not make descriptions for gods that I haven't asked for
Do not write repetitive sentences

The biggest thing I want you to take out of this is that they need to be consistent with the base game, like the examples I'm about to show you.

The following examples are from several factions and cultures in the game:

(
"This Shrine is dedicated to Vahagan, the God of Thunder, Clouds and Fire. He is a metalworker and smith to the other gods, a maker of weapons. It is in this capacity that he is honoured by warriors."

"This Shrine is dedicated to Anahit, once the Goddess of War, but also Goddess of Fertility and Birth. She is the chief of all the Armenian pantheon. As such, she is widely worshipped and respected for he influence in all areas of life."

"This Shrine is dedicated to Armazd, the Father of all Gods, and the Creator of heaven and earth. He is the source of all light and growth. The chief celebration in his honour is always held on the Spring equinox."

"This Shrine is dedicated to Zoroastra, the founder and creator of the Avesta. A sacred fire is kept burning at all times within the shrine. Zoroastra teaches that Ozmud, the creator and angel of good will triumph over Ahriman, the angel of evil, and that a man's fate depends on the good and evil in his life."

"This Shrine is dedicated to Baal, the Ruler of the Universe and the Rider of the Clouds. He is the source of life, and a powerful god of war. He is the god on which all others depend, and a wielder of thunderbolts. Worship of Baal also includes child sacrifice and holy prostitution among its other observances."

"This Shrine is dedicated to Melqart, the son of Baal and the Ruler of the Underworld."

"This Large Temple is dedicated to Tanit, the Queen of Heaven and Mother Goddess. Prayers are offered to her to ensure children, good harvests and tranquility in people's homes. She was Astarte to the Phoenicians, the original settlers of Carthage."
)


Those are the examples. Here are the cultures and names of gods I want you to make descriptions for, as well as internet sources for you to find information about them.

-To sort descr_regions
Steps:
Use macros to add a unique character to beginning of every region line
Use home key to ensure character will always be placed at beginning of line
Run to end of file

Then,

Find: \R(?!;)		; Can be replaced with whatever unique character you're using
Replace: \x{263a} (smiley face), regular expression

This will make it look very weird, but trust the process
Next,

Sort Lines Lexicographically Ascending

Finally,

Find: \x{263a}
Replace: \r\n

End result should be a sorted descr_regions with all the region details with it. Thanks for not sorting the regions when you were making the map, Kirsi (joking)

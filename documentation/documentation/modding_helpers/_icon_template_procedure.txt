---Logo steps:
Load 256x256 isolated logo in GIMP
Logo should already be centered but if its not, correct it
Select all non-transparent pixels
Shrink select by 1
Invert selection
Apply gaussian blur of 0.5
Select everything, apply antialias enhancement
Scale image to 416x416


---Template steps:
Load template
Fill 1st green layer with factions primary color
Set 1st layer mode to HSL color
If its too light, use LCH color
If its too dark, use the second HSV saturation layer
If its STILL too dark, set the bottom color layer to HSV hue
If its STILL STILL too dark, go to background layer and decrease intended color temp to 1625
Use 2nd green layer with HSV saturation only if color appears too dark
Load 416x416 logo onto new layer, set to overlay
Load logo again onto new layer, set to LCH color
If logo appears too dark, use HSL color
Load logo again onto new layer, hard light, set opacity to 20%. Experiment as needed
If too light, use HSV value layer as necessary

-For roll and select
Just use other background layer

Increase brightness of background by 40
OR set color temp to 1625 or 1220

-For grey logo:
-90 saturation for all color and logo layers, not background


Hide HSV saturation color layer (if used)
Hide HSV hue logo layer (if used)
Hide hard light layer (unless the logo becomes to faint)
Undo any brightness changes to background logo
Set main color layer to HSL color if you used HSV hue



---Old info that might be of use:
1 overlay layer
1 lch color layer above overlay
1 hard light layer 20% opacity
hard light layer hidden for grayscale logo

increase brightness & contrast of background by increments of 25 or 50 as needed
hide brightened background for greyscale logo, use original

apply color to green using fill with FG, switch its mode to hsl color
if color is too light and shows up dark, use second layer and apply same color but with hsv saturation

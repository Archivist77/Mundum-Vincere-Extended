{governors_house_arab_desc}
The Governor's House is the centre for all administrative functions in a settlement. This is the power of the state made solid for the people who live here.\n\nThe administrator based here collects taxes, issues instructions to improve the settlement and manages the small day-to-day business of an empire.\n\nWhile not exactly luxurious, the Governor's House is usually the best building in the settlement, and locals try to build their own houses close by so that some prestige rubs off on them!

{governors_house_arab_desc_short}
The Governor's House is the controlling hub of the settlement, and the basis of all state power. Without the enlightened state's presence, nothing else can develop.

{governors_villa_arab_desc}
The Governor's Villa is the place where important decisions are made, and it gives the locals a taste of grandeur. It  serves as a training ground in basic politics and the uses of power. The Villa is also a sign that the state's domination is permanent and secure.\n\nThe Villa allows development in a settlement to begin in earnest, as improvements to existing structures and new building projects are now possible.

{governors_villa_arab_desc_short}
The Governor's Villa is the centre of the settlement: the place where important decisions are made. It gives a 'touch of class' to the town and allows further development.

{governors_palace_arab_desc}
A Governor's Palace is a deliberately impressive symbol of authority and power. Its grandeur shows the locals the benefits of royal rule and the futility of rebellion. Because it is a major centre of government, diplomats receive training here too.\n\nThe Palace allows development to continue in the settlement around it: improvements to existing structures and new, advanced building projects can now be carried out.

The Governor's Palace is an important centre of political power, and a deliberately impressive symbol of the state's authority.

{proconsuls_palace_arab}	Councillors' Chambers

{proconsuls_palace_arab_desc}
The Councillors' Chambers are an unmissable symbol of the state's might: the building's size and luxury are intended to impress everyone. The bureaucrats based here collect taxes, manage improvements to the city and efficiently carry out all the business of empire.\n\nThe Chambers allow advanced developments to occur in a city, as costly building projects can be undertaken. All aspects of life within the city can be improved as a result: religious, military and economic.

{proconsuls_palace_arab_desc_short}
The Councillors' Chambers is an unmissable symbol of the state's authority. Those who live in their shadow can have no doubts as to who is in charge.

{imperial_palace_arab}	Royal Palace

{imperial_palace_arab_desc}
A Royal Palace is the ultimate expression of authority. The building's imposing size and ultimate luxury are intended to cow everyone. Those who live nearby have no doubts as to where power lies, while those inside control every aspect of life within the city.\n\nThe Royal Palace allows the most advanced construction works in a city: magnificence in all things can be the result.

{imperial_palace_arab_desc_short}
A Royal Palace is the ultimate expression in marble and stone of the state's power. Those who live outside its walls can have no doubt as to where power resides.



{wooden_pallisade_arab_desc}
A wall of logs around a settlement gives a comforting sense of security, but it cannot delay attackers for very long. It's enough to keep livestock from straying at night. That said a palisade like this is cheap and easy to erect even for an unskilled work force. It will help make a settlement feel like a homely place where people live, work and prosper.

{wooden_pallisade_arab_desc_short}
A wall of logs around a settlement gives some security, but it will not deter or delay attackers for very long.

{wooden_wall_arab_desc}
A rough wooden wall is a better defence than a palisade of stakes, but it is still not much of a problem to organised attackers. It will delay attackers getting into the settlement, and so is a good barrier against surprise raids. More organised attackers will, however, break the wall down sooner rather than later.\n\nThe wall also keeps locals and their livestock safe at night and gives a sense of permanence to a town. These walls are easy to construct with an unskilled workforce.  Improving the walls also adds grain stores to extend the time a settlement can resist a siege.

{wooden_wall_arab_desc_short}
A rough wooden wall is a better defence than a crude palisade, but it is not likely to present much of a problem to attackers.

{stone_wall_arab_desc}
Stone walls are fairly substantial but truly determined attackers will be able to breach them. With towers and gatehouses, these are formidable defences but not completely impregnable.\n\nThe need for security - and national pride - will mean that stone walls are desirable. These are defences that can protect the local people and offer protection to rural folk who flee from raiders.  Improving the walls also adds grain stores to extend the time a settlement can resist a siege.

{stone_wall_arab_desc_short}
Stone walls are fairly substantial and give a degree of security to a town, but truly determined attackers will be able to breach them.

{large_stone_wall_arab_desc}
Large stone walls are substantial with strong towers and gatehouses. Even organised enemies will have a hard time scaling them or breaking into the city and will need time and specialised siege equipment to succeed.\n\nImproving the walls also adds grain stores to extend the time a settlement can resist a siege. The wall is, however, expensive and time consuming to construct. Usually only prestigious or rich towns are worth protecting, they are monuments to the governors who build them!

{large_stone_wall_arab_desc_short}
Large walls are substantial, and even organised enemies will have a hard time scaling them or breaking into the city.

{epic_stone_wall_arab_desc}
These awesome walls are an extremely strong array of towers, gatehouses and battlements. They are difficult to breach - almost impossible without the right equipment - and a severe stumbling block to the plans of any conqueror. Raiding armies will sometimes turn back rather than futilely waste their time in front of such defences!\n\nImproving the walls also adds grain stores to extend the time a settlement can resist a siege. Construction of these walls is slow and immensely expensive, making them unlikely to be used except to protect capitals and cities of enormous wealth and importance.

{muster_field_arab_desc}
Barracks provide the basics for training a local force for defence. They can be upgraded as the city grows to produce better troops.\n\nBarracks are not salubrious or comfortable, but then they don't have to be - the men aren't here for a rest cure, but to be toughened up and to learn enough drill to be useful in war!

{muster_field_arab_desc_short}
Barracks provide the basics for training soldiers. They can be upgraded as the town grows to produce better troops.

{militia_barracks_arab_desc}
Militia Barracks have better facilities to train and house semi-regular soldiery. They can be improved as the town, its population and wealth grow. Being citizens-at-arms, these men have chosen to defend their homes and loved ones, but they may not be as 'professional' as full time soldiers. Their barracks are clean, but lack creature comforts - these men are here to learn the skills of war and defend the state, not enjoy themselves!

{militia_barracks_arab_desc_short}
Militia Barracks have better facilities to train and house regular soldiers. They can be improved as the town grows.

{city_barracks_arab_desc}
A City Barracks is a major building in any town, allowing many troops to be trained here. It is a symbol of the military might of the state, and a vital part of the army's support structure.\n\nThe men trained here have a real stake in the community, one worth defending. The skills gained allow them to fight as organised formations, something that takes time and discipline to learn to do properly.

{city_barracks_arab_desc_short}
City Barracks are a major structure allowing many troops to be trained. They are a highly visible military presence, and can be developed further.

{army_barracks_arab_desc}
These imposing barracks are often the largest buildings in a city after the palace, and include extensive drill and training yards. Army Barracks are also deliberately large to make it quite clear where the power lies to anyone harbouring disloyal thoughts!\n\nDiscipline is often harsh, but the soldiers who are trained here are among the best available to the state. 

{army_barracks_arab_desc_short}
These imposing Army Barracks are often the largest buildings in a city after the palace. They include extensive drill and training facilities.

{royal_barracks_arab_desc}
Royal Barracks are extremely large and well-appointed, as might be expected of a country's most important military buildings. They include extensive drill and training facilities: the very best that can be provided. The barracks themselves are deliberately imposing to show the world the true might of the state.\n\nThe soldiers live relatively well, although discipline is hard. As a result, the elite trained here are expected to be the finest, bravest soldiers that are sent into battle.

{royal_barracks_arab_desc_short}
Royal Barracks are extremely large and well-appointed, as might be expected of a country's most important military facilities.



{stables_arab_desc}
This is the basic building required for training all cavalry units. Stables can be improved as the settlement grows so that a wider range of cavalry types - that require different types of horse - can be trained.\n\nHorses are far too valuable to be used for farming (oxen, donkeys and slaves are used instead), and are bred for war, not work. Just about every horse-using nation is highly stratified, as horses are expensive to rear and keep. Having the skills to ride one is a mark of belonging to the aristocracy.

{stables_arab_desc_short}
This is the basic building required for training all cavalry units. Stables can be improved as the settlement grows.

{cavalry_barracks_arab_desc}
Cavalry Stables produce the superior horses that are needed to train horsemen for more advanced kinds of units. They include training yards where superior horsemanship can be taught to the men, and the horses schooled to face the noise and terror of battle (something that does not come naturally to them).\n\nThis building can be upgraded further when the settlement grows.

{cavalry_barracks_arab_desc_short}
Cavalry Stables produce the superior horses that are then used when advanced cavalrymen are trained. This building can be upgraded further when the settlement grows.

{hippodrome_arab}	Elite Cavalry Stables

{hippodrome_arab_desc}
Elite Cavalry Stables train some of the finest mounted soldiers available to any army. Horses and men are looked after in considerable luxury - at least compared to where infantry are expected to live! Farriers and specialised armourers are also found here, allowing many types of cavalry to be trained.\n\nThese stables may also include facilities for training and housing other war beasts, such as elephants. This alone can make the building a valuable part of the military infrastructure.\n\nThis building cannot be upgraded. 

{hippodrome_arab_desc_short}

{practice_field_arab_desc}
Learning to skirmish effectively requires an open space where lightly armed and armoured troops can safely practice with missile weapons. There are also the tactics of movement and disengagement to be practiced, which also needs more space than a simple yard for close-order drills.

{practice_field_arab_desc_short}
The arts of skirmishing are not the same as fighting in a close battle line. Space is needed to train troops to do this effectively.

{archery_range_arab_desc}
Archery is a skill that takes time and patience to perfect: the strength to use a bow well is only acquired through long hours of practice. Most recruits know how to use a bow from hunting, but this is different from using a bow in battle. An Archery Range gives the space for bowmen to further develop their skills and practice group tactics.

{archery_range_arab_desc_short}
Archers need space to practice constantly before, during and after being formed into military units. Good archers require strength as well as co-ordination.

{catapult_range_arab_desc}
It is always better to attack an enemy from a distance, for then he cannot always strike back. A Catapult Range lets artillerists, archers and javelinmen fire away to their hearts content during training - and all without the risk of killing too many innocent bystanders! The engineers needed to build large artillery weapons are nearby, and can assist in the training of crews. Other missile troops can use the same range during their training.

{catapult_range_arab_desc_short}
A Catapult Range lets artillerists, archers and javelinmen fire away to their hearts content during training - and all without the risk of killing too many innocent bystanders!

{siege_engineer_arab_desc}
A Siege Engineer designs and builds the largest artillery weapons. Useful during siege operations, artillery can also be used to break up large formations in field battles. Their construction requires skilled work and an understanding of many engineering principles. In addition to making the weapons, a siege engineer also makes sure that the crew know enough to be a danger to the enemy and not themselves!\n\nThere is also a practice range allowing other missile armed troops to be trained here.

{siege_engineer_arab_desc_short}
A Siege Engineer designs and builds large artillery weapons. He also makes sure that the crew know enough to be a danger to the enemy and not themselves.



{trader_arab_desc}
The Trader sells some local produce to other settlements increasing - in a small way - the wealth of the community. Trade carries risks, but it is an excellent way of increasing wealth, because settlements and nations flourish when they are mutually supporting, not attempting to be entirely self sufficient.\n\nTrade can, of course, be taxed. It can also be improved when this building is upgraded.

{trader_arab_desc_short}
The Trader sells some local produce to other settlements increasing - in a small way - the wealth of the community.

{market_arab_desc}
As a settlement grows the returns on trade improve too, as long as merchants are encouraged to do business. An organised Market allows locals to trade and brings in outside traders too. It's a place for people to meet, buy and sell, and catch up on gossip. Many goods are available, including information - at the right price.\n\nTrade can, of course, be taxed. It can also be improved when this building is upgraded.\n\nThe Market is also a place to hire those who specialise in the information business.

{market_arab_desc_short}

{forum_arab}	Bazaar

{forum_arab_desc}
Trade flourishes where it is encouraged. The Bazaar is a meeting place as much as a trading centre, and almost anything can be bought here, when the price is right.\n\nIn the hustle and bustle of this busy market anything and everything is for sale, even a man's secrets - or his sudden death!\n\nTrade can, of course, be taxed. It can also be improved when this building is upgraded.

{forum_arab_desc_short}
Trade flourishes where it is encouraged. In the hustle and bustle of the busy Bazaar anything can be bought and sold, even a man's life. 

{great_forum_arab}	Grand Bazaar

{great_forum_arab_desc}
If it can't be bought or sold somewhere among the traders in the Grand Bazaar, then 'it' probably isn't worth bothering about, whatever it might be. This is the great centre of all business in a city, a place where goods from across the known world can be found. Anything - even a man's loyalty, his secrets or his demise - can be bought when the price is right.\n\nSuch extensive trading activity can, of course, be taxed. It can also be improved when this building is upgraded.

{great_forum_arab_desc_short}
If it can't be bought or sold somewhere among the traders in the Grand Bazaar, then 'it' probably isn't worth bothering about!

{curia_arab}	Merchants' Quarter

{curia_arab_desc}
A Merchants' Quarter is the commercial hub of many provinces. Anything imaginable is available to a man with gold in his purse.\n\nTrade can do little else but flourish when a complete section of a city is turned over to the merchant classes. From their villas and warehouses the merchants control all trade within a region, bringing in riches and exotic goods in the process. That trade can be taxed (to the hilt, if need be) is part of the cost of doing business. 

{curia_arab_desc_short}
A Merchants' Quarter is the commercial hub of many provinces. Trade can do little else but flourish when a whole city section is turned over to the merchant classes. 



{blacksmith_arab_desc}
A blacksmith provides superior quality weaponry for any troops trained in the settlement. His skills in metal working are exceptional, far beyond those of ordinary smiths who make agricultural implements.\n\nHe is an important man in the community, as good weapons are always valued by the men who have to use them. A Blacksmith who can make a strong sword that won't break or bend in combat is a great asset to his people.

{blacksmith_arab_desc_short}
A blacksmith provides superior quality weaponry for any troops trained in the settlement. This building can be developed further.

{smiths_workshop_arab_desc}
An armourer works closely with a blacksmith, and produces fine armour to match the smith's weaponry. His work is highly valued by military men - well-made armour can often mean the difference between life and death! When his skills are added to those of a blacksmith in producing weapons, the armourer ensures that any troops trained in this settlement will be equipped to a very high standard. 

{smiths_workshop_arab_desc_short}
An armourer works closely with a blacksmith, and produces fine armour to match the smith's superior weapons.

{foundry_arab_desc}
A foundry is the final metalworking development found only in the larger cities: a factory where very high quality armour and weaponry can be produced quickly, and in quantity.\n\nAny troops trained in this city will be equipped to the highest standard possible, making them formidable in combat, providing of course, that they are well motivated and properly commanded!

{foundry_arab_desc_short}
A foundry is the final metalworking development found only in the larger cities: a factory where very high quality armour and weaponry can be produced quickly, and in quantity. 



{port_arab_desc}
A port brings trade and wealth to a settlement, and allows the construction of simple ships. Access to the sea is vital for all long distance trade. The sea lanes are the true highways of the world, and carrying goods by ship is the only way to move them cheaply enough to make a profit. Indeed, it is usually cheaper and quicker to send a cargo halfway across the world by sea than to the next city in a cart!\n\nMilitarily, ports are important because they have the men and equipment needed to build a fleet.

{port_arab_desc_short}
A port brings trade and wealth to a settlement, and allows the construction of simple ships.

{shipwright_arab_desc}
A shipwright can build the warships needed for a strong fleet, while the improved port facilities allow more goods to be landed at and forwarded from the settlement.\n\nAs a port grows wealth flows into the town, and all manner of goods become available to the people.\n\nMilitarily, the improvements in ship-building usually lead to better ship-handling and tactics.

{shipwright_arab_desc_short}
A shipwright can build the warships needed for a strong fleet, while the improved port facilities allow more goods to be landed at and forwarded from the settlement.

{dockyard_arab_desc}
A Dockyard has the equipment and skilled craftsmen needed to construct the largest and most advanced warships afloat, while the port can speedily handle many merchant vessels.\n\nThe city's merchants can easily send their cargoes to any port in the world, adding greatly to the wealth of the city and in return exotic goods from all over the world pass through the docks.\n\nThe Dockyard can produce any warship required by the fleet, and even provide the crews of slave rowers required by these large and powerful ships.

{dockyard_arab_desc_short}
A Dockyard has the equipment and skilled craftsmen needed to construct the largest and most advanced warships afloat, while the port can speedily handle many merchant vessels.



{sewers_arab_desc}
Sewers efficiently wash away the filth and rubbish from a settlement, making the place cleaner. Indeed, one measure of civilization might be the distance between one's nose and the final resting place of one's bowel movements! Sewers therefore help civilization's forward march.

{sewers_arab_desc_short}
Sewers efficiently wash away the filth and rubbish from a settlement, making the place cleaner and therefore healthier for the people.

{baths_arab_desc}
Public baths play an important part in the social life of the town; they are a place to meet as much as somewhere to get clean. Baths are often among the most magnificent of public buildings, and include cunning heating systems and many slaves to look after the needs of the citizens.

{farms_arab}	Land Clearance

{farms_arab_desc}
An improvement on slash-and-burn farming around a settlement, land clearances allow a surplus of food and encourage population growth.\n\nSubsistence farming, where people can only just feed themselves and their families, does not free people to do anything more than scrabble for a living. However, if agriculture improves even marginally, there will be growth in a settlement.\n\nThis kind of farming can be upgraded as the settlement grows.

{farms_arab_desc_short}
An improvement on slash-and-burn farming around a settlement, land clearances allow a surplus of food and encourage growth.

{farms+1_arab}	Communal Farming

{farms+1_arab_desc}
Once slash-and-burn agriculture has worn out the land, one response is for farming communities to organise, and work collectively. Communal farming produces a surplus through minor economies of scale: tools and resources are pooled, and everyone works as a team to gather the harvest. Individual failures are minimised by these methods, and the increased output adds to population growth.\n\nThis kind of farming can be upgraded as the settlement grows.

{farms+1_arab_desc_short}
Communal farming produces a surplus that goes to market and this always ends up in a settlement, encouraging growth. People won't stay where there isn't enough to eat!

{farms+2_arab}	Crop Rotation

{farms+2_arab_desc}
Crop rotation and basic land management techniques stop farms from becoming rapidly exhausted. By changing field usage every year and allowing land to lie fallow or be used as pasture, the goodness of the land is slowly restored. Crop yields and surpluses improve as a result, and the increased output adds to population growth. Slave labour also helps, as peasant farmers generally keep more produce for themselves.\n\nThis kind of farming can be upgraded as the settlement grows.

{farms+2_arab_desc_short}
Crop rotation and basic land management techniques stop farms from becoming rapidly exhausted; yields and surpluses improve as a result.

{farms+3_arab}	Irrigation

{farms+3_arab_desc}
Damming rivers and using waterwheels to raise water to fields is labour intensive, but the pay offs can be spectacular. In some parts of the world it's even possible to gather more than one harvest a year when irrigation is used. Overall, extensive irrigation systems improve all farm production, creating even larger surpluses that can be sent to support a growing urban population.

{farms+3_arab_desc_short}
Extensive irrigation systems improve farm production, creating larger surpluses that can be sent to support a growing urban population.

{farms+4_arab}	Great Estates

{farms+4_arab_desc}
The need to grow even more food leads to increases in the size and efficiency of farms. Great estates are put together by confiscating land from peasant farmers. Worked by their former owners, these giant estates produce huge surpluses and are very profitable to the new owners. It's all down to economies of scale in the operation.

{farms+4_arab_desc_short}
Great Estates are enormous (and efficient) farms that are created by confiscating land from peasant farmers. 



{roads_arab_desc}
These minor roads have been made usable by the military only where necessary, and for the most part they are ancient tracks worn into the landscape, created over generations.\n\nMilitary engineers improve these ancient ways a little with simple bridges, a stony roadbed in marshy spots and by cutting back vegetation. They are not ideal but are certainly better than nothing.\n\nIn addition, tolls can be collected at certain key crossings.

{roads_arab_desc_short}
Roads are vital to territorial defence, allowing armies to move to meet any threat.

{paved_roads_arab_desc}
These improved roads allow armies to assemble and then meet approaching enemies swiftly. Paved roads are built for military use first and foremost. They are carefully surveyed and constructed, often including cuttings and extensive causeways. They will not degenerate into muddy rivers in winter or dusty tracks in summer, no matter how hard the usage.\n\nWith these better conditions, tolls can be collected more efficiently and at more locations on the road.

{paved_roads_arab_desc_short}
These improved roads allow armies to assemble swiftly and then march great distances to meet approaching enemies.

{mines_arab_desc}
Mines are needed to exploit the natural wealth of a province, although the dangerous underground work costs the lives of many slaves.\n\nMost mines are not very deep, as they are dug by back-breaking labour and follow the richest seams of ore into hillsides (drift mining), rather than having vertical mine shafts.\n\nWhere gold and silver are to be found, mining is sure to be a priority of the land's overlords.

These deeper Mines exploit the wealth of a region more efficiently, allowing seams of ore to be dug out even below the water table.\n\nIn addition to the miners, teams of slaves are used to lift water out of the workings using treadmill-powered waterwheels. Working in a mine like this is usually a deferred death sentence.\n\nThe wealth extracted by these mines is more than enough to make a handsome profit and pay for a constant influx of new slave labourers.

{execution_square_arab_desc}
An Execution Square does much to quell all rebellious spirits, and introduces a certain happiness with their lot to the common folk.\n\nFear is a splendid way of ensuring public loyalty and ensuring obedience. The loss of one or even a hundred people as object lessons in obedience is regrettable, but the remainder will learn that obedience to the established order brings... old age.\n\nAn Execution Square can be upgraded as the town grows and the need for further law and order measures becomes pressing.

{secret_police_hq_arab_desc}
The Secret Police make sure that foolish and rebellious people simply disappear. Peace, good order and tranquility are maintained. But sometimes it is not enough simply to execute naysayers and the disloyal. Those who question the order of things must be rooted out before they can cause their fellow subjects to become unhappy.\n\nThe Secret Police can be improved as the city grows in size.

{secret_police_hq_arab_desc_short}

{secret_police_network_arab_desc}
Better even than the Secret Police are a network of informers. Far better to have hidden servants listening to the words - and watching for the deeds - that betray unhappiness. And when anyone might be a servant of the state, everyone watches: failure to report on disloyalty can be construed as disloyalty also. Good order is thus maintained and enhanced by these unsung heroes of the people: the rebellious tongue remains still when it may be cut off!

{caravan_arab_desc}
Goods from the mysterious East are carried across the trackless wastes by a Caravan, increasing the trading wealth of the settlement. Exotic goods from as far away as the Indus and China reach the Mediterranean world carried on the backs of long camel trains.\n\nA Caravan can be upgraded as the settlement grows in size and importance.

{frankincense_rd_arab_desc}
A handful of nutmeg can make a man wealthy for the rest of his days. That the spice has to be carried across the world to gain these riches is unimportant. The 'Spice Road' trade route from the East brings some of this trading wealth to a town.\n\nSpices - thanks to their rarity - are a valuable, transportable commodity, and their use is a sign of sophistication and wealth. The demand for exotic tastes and flavours cannot be sated, even by the many camel loads of spice that make the risky journey West.\n\nA Spice Road trading route can be upgraded as the city increases in size.

{silk_rd_arab_desc}
The 'Silk Road' trade route brings all the finest of goods from the distant East to a city. Silks are only part of the trade: rare spices, ivory, precious gems and all kinds of exotic items are carried in camel loads to be traded in the West. Men can grow fabulously rich on the proceeds of this trade, and their wealth trickles down through society. It can also be lucratively taxed, because 'protecting' all that wealth can be an expensive business!

ALL STEPS WERE MADE WITH PAINT.NET 5.0.11

-----FOR EASTERN BANNERS
Coloring:
1. make top and 2nd to top layer visible (should be green and pink)
2. back on top layer, use magic wand to select pink on with about 56% tolerance
3. make layers invisible again
4. go to bottom layer, keeping selection
5. select color of banner, make it secondary color
6. make the primary color the factions main color, either in descr_sm_factions or by getting color of faction icon
7. using recolor tool, recolor the selected area. recoloring should look nice
8. go back to top layer, merge layer down (without saving)
9. remake ltop layer visible (should have green and pink again)
10. use magic wand to select green with about 56% tolerance
11. make layer invisible
12. go back to bottom layer
13. select color of outer part of banner, make it secondary color
14. make the primary color the factions secondary color, using methods from step 6
15. using recolor tool, recolor selected area
16. there might be some ugly overlap on the sides, that's just how it is :sadface:

--FOR BANNER BIG
1. resize icon to 1055x1055
1alt. select all parts of emblem
2. select all parts of the emblem with as much tolerance as possible without copying whole thing
2alt. copy to new file with same dimensions
3. make new, transparent file with same dimensions as emblem
3alt. resize to to 855xwhatever, with maintain aspect ratio
4. copy-paste emblem to that file
4alt. skip and continue as ormal
5. resize canvas to size of banner big, with picture in middle
6. delete white to make transparency
7. copy-paste banner big as new layer (with as much tolerance as possible when selecting from banner template)
8. make emblem top layer
9. make top emblem have transparency 200/233
9a. make top emblem have transparency 133/166 for ally version
10. merge layer down
11. copy and paste back to original file/allied copy and then do steps for thin banner

--FOR BANNER THIN
Very similar to big banner
1. when resizing canvas, first resize to same width, and 400 less than thin banner height with emblem in MIDDLE
2. then resize to full banner thin height, with emblem on TOP
3. this will result in the emblem being high, but not at the top nor at the middle


Color settings: 60% hardness, 15% spacing, 50% tolerance


NOTES:
Basically repeat steps for other faction banners

200 less width for thin, 400 less width for big. can take 50-100 more if emblem fits large
If emblem is too long, do 400 less LENGTH for big, 300 less width for thin

For greco-roman, select green with 64% tolerance, select pink with 56% tolerance

Secondary color: 108 108 108

When coloring in for banner, you actually don't realy need to select main color as secondary color

When coloring in, click on lighter parts for darker coloring, darker parts for lighter coloring, and medium gray parts for moderate coloring (towards the middle of the banner for barbarian)

Barbarian banner has less steps since its only one color. Use faction's primary color only

For consistency, try sampling and coloring in starting at the bottom tip of the left banner

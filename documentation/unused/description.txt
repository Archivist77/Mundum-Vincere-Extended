Since there are many new factions on the campaign map, you might find yourself besieged much more often, making the campaign a lot harder. It is recommended to play on easier difficulties

Most of the new factions have generic rosters due to the sheer number of factions, but there are some new units to fit the needs of certain regional factions. Most new factions lack unique faction colors.
